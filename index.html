  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Current robotics programmer (and master's student) at
    <span class="hover-image-trigger color-cmu">
      Carnegie Mellon University
      <img src="assets/Brian@CMU.jpg" alt="CMU Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>
    developing control interfaces in game/physics engines for humanoid robots.
    Previously co-founded

      HIRN Interactive
      <img src="assets/Brian@HIRN.jpg" alt="HIRN Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>
    making virtual reality software for neuroscience research communication. And prior to that,
    Honours bachelor's of science at the
    <span class="hover-image-trigger color-uoft">
      University of Toronto
      <img src="assets/Brian@UofT.jpg" alt="UofT Hover Image" class="hover-image" />
    </span>, with a focus in computational neuroscience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tried using silicon computers to understand the fleshy computers,
    gave up after realizing the fleshy computers are too dang complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nowadays I'm more interested in robotics, computer vision, graphics, VR/AR/MR,
    and occasionally revisiting my roots in neuroscience.
    There's a surprising amount of overlap across these fields, both in their applications and underlying principles.
    Linear algebra and vector calculus never seems to go out of style in these domains.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I doubt there's a job where I get to combine all of these interests,
    I will continue to hone my fundamentals until the day that job comes along.

      <h3>iLuceal | Virtual Pet on the Apple Vision Pro</h3>
      <p>
        Pitched and presented the project to CMU faculty during fall 2024, conducted during spring 2025.
        Recruited others to the cause, forming a project team of 2 programmers, 1 3D modeler, 1 animator, 1 tech-artist, and 1 producer
      </p>
      <p>
        Lead the team through rough patches during the project semester.
        Programmed the ESP32 in C as an input device for the Apple Vision Pro.
        Designed the electronic sensors from semi-conductive graphite sheets.
        Assisted with the Unity gameplay scripts in C#.

      <h3>4-way split projection arcade game Jamo-O-Drum</h3>
      <p>
        Building Virtual World Project
      </p>
      <p>
        A "hackathon" style project where 2 artists, 2 programmers, and 1 sound designer create a game in 10 days.
        We made a AR "hide and seek" game on a novel arcade platform in collaboration of CMU ECE students.
        My role was mainly programming the game logic to utilize the unique perspectives enabled via the high refresh rate
        LCD glasses that's synchronized with the projector.

      <h3>Custom split keyboard</h3>
      <p>
        Made my own custom 3D printed split keyboard with PCB from Keebio, Sakurio switch stems from Zeal Generation,
        shoved into Holy Panda housing @ 67g of actuation force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wrote a custom firmware in C that would make the rotary encoder on the PCB run different
        macros when different modifier keys are held (e.g. when holding ctrl, spinning it counter-clock-wise
        is undo (ctrl+z), spinning it clock-wise is redo (ctrl+shift+z))
